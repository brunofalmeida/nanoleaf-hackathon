# Nanoleaf Aurora Rhythm Hackathon

A plugin created for the [Nanoleaf Aurora Rhythm Hackathon](https://nanoleaf.me/en-ca/consumer-led-lighting/join-beta-program/aurora-rhythm-hackathon-signup/) at the University of Toronto.

The plugin is written in C++ for the Nanoleaf Aurora, a set of modular lighting panels. It responds to music and creates patterns on the Aurora.
